**What did you learn about CSS padding, borders, and margin by doing this challenge?**

I learned that CSS padding, borders and margins are things you have to continuously practice with. After a while, I began to understand how each was measured in the page. I think the trickiest one is the padding especially since my links have so much padding that you can click on my link from the other end of the page even though it's blank.


**What did you learn about CSS positioning?**

I learned that it becomes easier to maneuver. I also learned that you can add space between elements when using padding.


**What aspects of your design did you find easiest to implement? What was most difficult?**

I found my background image to be the easiest. The most difficult is keeping the links at the bottom of my page so that it's the last thing I see when I scroll down.


**What did you learn about adding and formatting elements with CSS in this challenge?**

I learned that once the CSS file is linked to the HTML file, connecting the elements is pretty simple. For DOM objects, you can use it's name, for classes you use a period and for ids you use a hash. The design elements that go in between the braces can easily be found in sublime or online. The style name are ones you cannot easily forget such as 'color', 'font-weight' or 'font-size.'
