  <h1>Thinking Style:</h1>
  <h2>Abstract Random, Aural & Kinesthetic</h2>
  <h4>August 16, 2015</h4>

    <p>
     In Phase 0, we were given material to help us determine what our learning styles were. We had two sources to to look at, the Gregoric Thinking Styles and VARK. I had no idea what to expect from the assignment but I was grateful for the assistance in guiding me to figure out what learning style truly pertained to me. In fact, at the end of my 3rd week, its acually come in really handy. I've come to find out that my Gregoric Thinking Style is Abstract Random and my VARK thinking style is Aural Kinesthetic(AK).
    </p>
    <p>
      I'll start with Abstract Random. People who fall under this category tend to be listeners. We focus on the problems in the present and want to pursue healthy relationships. We also like to have some sort of guideline just in case we're caught up in our many ideas running through our minds. On the not so bright side, we have a very difficult time working with authoritarian and unfriendly characters. Restrictive environments are not pleasant to us and criticism, even if positive, still hurt.
    </p>
    <p>
      On tVARK spectrum, Aural Kinesthetic learners are also listeners. We thrive on stories, speakers and discussions. We also like to use our senses to learn and be in a moment where we're learning by doing. Practicing and working on many examples will allow us to get the hang of things.
    </p>

      Who knew a questionnaire could be so on point in defining how I apply myself when learning! This made me feel a bit better about myself and going into the DBC experience. It made me realize that it's okay to be the way I am. When I first found out about peer pairing, I was terrified. I was afraid of being judged, working with difficult people and not being as good as my peers. So far, I've been able to read what my peers have written as well as meet a few of them. That's allowed me to get a feel for who I will be working with. At one point, there was a time I doubted myself so my peer also seemed to doubt me. I didn't like how I felt so I worked more on that issue and applied a little more assertiveness and certainty in myself soon after. 
    </p>
    <p>
      Part of my struggles come from my learning styles and part of it comes simply from my critical inner voice. Actually, watching the video about the critical inner voice helped me as well. But that's another blog in itself. Looking at my learning styles, I want to be able to work with authoritarian characters better as well as learn how to find my voice in restrictive settings. I also hope to apply new techniques that work well for others in thinking and solving problems. Everyday is a step at a time that I get to work on myself personally and educationally. I am learning by confronting my fears, I'm learning from my peers, and I'm opening up myself to this journey.
