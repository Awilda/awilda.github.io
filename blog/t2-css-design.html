  <h1>'class' vs 'id'</h1>

      Here's a simple way to differentiate a 'class' from a 'div':
      <br>
      <br>
      1. 'class' is used when you want to make changes to several different items. Here's an example of what may use a class:<br>
      <br>
      <ul>
        <li>One</li>
        <li>Two</li>
        <li>Three</li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      This bullet pointed list is an unordered list. Using a class for these allows us to make each one of them look the same using CSS if we wanted to.
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      2. 'id' can be used to make changes to one element. For instance:
      <br>
      <br>
      <h3>Heading</h3>
      <br>
      Most headings are normally elements that will be designed separately. In that case an 'id' would be used.
