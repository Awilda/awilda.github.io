  <h1>Version Control</h1>
  <h2>Let's talk about it</h2>
  <h4>July 31, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      Imagine a database in your computer in which you could add folders and documents, save files, share files to other people and even edit them. Yes, you can do all of these tasks by clicking and scrolling around your computer. But I'm not talking about going to your documents to open them, to then save them, then to email it over to someone. I'm talking about 'Version Control' where you can actually perform these tasks all in one place. Version control does work with commands but with some practice and repetition, you can definitely get the gist of it. It's a great tool for developers who are collaborating on a project. Not only could you share your work with your peers, you can also merge your work, make comments, and have a recorded history of all your activities.
    </p>
    <p>
        Git, a type of version control, allows people to do all of those things. So, let's say you made some edits to a file. On the command line in your terminal (where you write commands that allow you to save, share, etc.), you can type "git status." As a result, you should see a message that reads "modified" followed by the name of the file you just edited. Now, you want to add the modified file so you can simply type in "git add" followed by the file name. Okay, the file is modified and added so now we want to save it. In this version control world saving is called a commit and would look like this "git commit -m 'A message.'" The -m will be followed by the clear message you want to present about your latest change. This message will go in the parenthesis after -m. You're almost done. Let's say you want to save it into a repository (public online file). Assuming you already have a repository set up, you can now push it there by typing "git push." Now, your edited file is both on your computer and online, most likely in Github. 
    </p>
    <p>
        So, why would anyone want to store their work in Github? There are truly great perks to having your code stored in Github. I mentioned earlier that it was a good tool for collaborating developers. But anyone can see your code (unless you make it private) and who knows, someone could help make your code better. Also, with all the changes that go on, Github records this history so you can go back to a past file. For anyone whose accidentally deleted an important paper for school, don't you wish you knew about Github?
