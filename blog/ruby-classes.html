  <h1>Ruby Classes</h1>
  <h4>September 28, 2015</h4>

<p>There's a rule in Ruby called 'DRY', aka 'Don't repeat yourself.' Why? Because it's just so messy. They say good code is readable so if it's 'DRY' it's not readable which means it's not good. This leads me to the topic about classes.<p>

<p>We now know that everything in Ruby is an object. We also know that we can give variables arrays and hashes. We can be as organized as we want an make lists of objects. For example, we can create a roll book, or attendance book. You remember those! We can add each student's first and last names to it, right? But what if we wanted to check for attendance?</p>

<p>This is where a class comes in to focus. Classes give us a more real world feel to our code. With classes, we can create and object that won't be found in Ruby docs. Instead, we get to make things happen with a combination of those methods, iterations and variables. So if we wanted to "X" out all of the students that are present in a class, we can do so using a class.</p>

<p>So, how does this class work? We first give our class a name such as 'class RollBook.' Then we define our first method, 'initialize' followed by as many other methods needed to do what it is we want to do. So we don't confuse variables inside the class with any that may be outside the class, we can use instance variables. Those start with '@' in the beginning of the variable. Once we have solved how to add an 'X' to the names of the students in attendance, we do the driver code. This is where we can add the names of the students in attendance. As a result, the class will work it's magic and 'X' out the names.</p>
