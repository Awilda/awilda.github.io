  <h1>Fireside Chat with Shereef:</h1>
  <h2>My take on the DBC experience</h2>
  <h4>August 2, 2015</h4>

    <p>
      At the beginning of this year when I was trying to write out a plan for my web development journey, Dev Bootcamp appeared to me. What stood out to me about this program was that they seemed to care about the well being of the students as well as maintaining a positive environment throughout the intensive learning process. After watching Shereef's video, I see that this idea still stands. I feel that the DBC experience is not only about learning to code but also about growth, being a team player and learning important values. Surely, there will be many different characteristics entering the program and I feel that with the DBC experience we will learn more about ourselves through our interactions. We will find out how we best learn and be able to adapt to other learning techniques as well as other characteristics. What really attracts me to DBC is the balance they enforce whether it's taking breaks or practicing yoga. I know most of us, if not all, are eager and excited to learn and won't want to leave our screens. Finding a balance will also create a new habit for us for a healthier lifestyle.

        Most of the time when I'm starting something new, I'm extremely nervous. I automatically feel like I will be judged right away for not being as extroverted as most people. For the first time, I'm beyond excited and actually comfortable in my own skin. I see myself being able to open up to my peers since phase 0 will allow me get acquainted with everyone before the in-house phases. I see my cohort as a support system and one of the best ways to learn is by tackling a challenge together.
