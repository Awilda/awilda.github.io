  <h1>Diversity in Tech</h1>
  <h4>August 24, 2015</h4>

<p>It's almost 2am as I'm writing this blog post. So, I'm tired but I'm sitting up straighter as I write this post. Being able to write about diversity in tech is very important to me because this issue strongly resonates with me. I never dreamt about working in tech, I didn't think I was smart enough and I felt I wasn't the type to fit in. When people think about web developers, they think of hoodied white young men sitting in front of their computers for hours straight. Maybe that was the case at one point but it isn't today. Today the tech industry, not only developers are filled with men and women from different backgrounds and around the world. It's not 100% diverse but it'll get there<p>

<p>First, there are some issue that must be resolved. For instance, earlier this year I read an issue of Glamour magazine that featured women in tech. I remember feeling like that was a sign and this is what I'm meant to be doing. However, when I started reading I couldn't believe the way many of these women were disrespected just for being women. I couldn't believe harrassment some of these women faced on a day to day basis. They have the same skills as their fellow male peers. Yet, they were treated differently. When this changes, the tech industry will be better. After all, aren't we here to help others through technology?</p>

<p>Secondly, as a Latina I also know there aren't as many minorities in this field. I wouldn't consider pointing any blame towards anyone, though. I believe the problem comes from the lack of awareness of what the tech field entails. However, there are many programs out there teaching children from various backgrounds how to code and I feel like that's a positive first step.</p>
