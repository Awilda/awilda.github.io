  <h1>Online Security</h1>
  <h4>September 13, 2015</h4>

<p>I decided to write about online security because this is a topic I didn't know much about. So, I conducted some research and I'm glad I did because online security is a big deal and most online users have no idea of the everyday risks they take. We live in a digital world where the only thing that seems to secure us are passwords...or so many of us think. Most, if not all millenials such as myself grew up with the start of social media. And frankly, I think we've been the most reckless of all. It was experimental for us and this new digital platform gave us another way to express ourselves and communicate. Eventually, that became the norm and almost any company you could think of began using the internet to also reach out to people.</p>

<p>Like in real life, there will always be thieves or in this case- hackers. This is where security comes into place. Yes, we have passwords but are they really enough? Here's what I learned: It takes more than a simple password to be secure. In fact, it takes a lot of work to be secure. Here's a list of some online security risks to take:

<ol>
  <li>Keep passwords long(use caps, numbers and symbols)</li>
  <li>Don't be so obvious with your passwords(DOB, pet's names, favorite teams, etc.)
  <li>Use different passwords every time</li>
  <li>Install anti-virus on your computer</li>
  <li>Check your browser's privacy settings</li>
  <li>Do automatic updates</li>
  <li>Back-up your information</li>
  <li>Don't share any personal information</li>
  <li>Protect your own WIFI</li>
  <li>Don't enter information onto a site that doesn't start with 'https'</li>
  <li>Be careful what you share</li>
</ol>

<p>What I've learned here is that backing-up my computer (in my case a simple usb with a lot of space works fine for me) is a good practice just in case I accidentally get hit with a virus. However, to prevent a virus from even happening, I can be cautious of how I use the internet. The more you share, the easier it is for valuable information to be extracted. And as tedious as it may seem to have multiple passwords, it doesn't hurt to have an old-fashioned notebook with your passwords in a secure place. There are, however, security tools out there to prevent this, but it's not something many users know about. One security tool is called PGP(Pretty Good Privacy) that encrypts digital data and was created to create online security awareness. Right now, security tools aren't the hype but until then, please play it safe. </p>
