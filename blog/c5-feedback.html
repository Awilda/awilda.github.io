  <h1>Feedback</h1>
  <h4>August 30, 2015</h4>

<p>When I first heard about the mandatory peer pairing sessions at DBC, I was terrified. This meant I had to get out of my comfort zone at least three times a week. But like any other fear I faced, I knew I had to face it to overcome it.<p>

<p>Some of the first couple of sessions weren't as smooth as I'd hoped. I let my nerves get the better of me and I was unsure of my abilities. Inside, I knew I could do these challenges. I learned HTML and CSS before yet my doubt reflected towards my peers. Although, I was comfortable with the earlier material, I was afraid to voice my ideas.</p>

<p>When the time came to read my reflection, I didn't take it all so well. I felt like I was the one holding my peers back. This wasn't true for all my feedbacks but the more negative comments still seemed to weigh down on me.</p>

<p>Eventually, I got over the feeling of not being good enough. After all, we are all learning how to code and giving each other constructive criticism is part of the journey. Through this experience I learned to be more sharp, to take more initiative and to be better prepared. I want to be a good developer some day so I'll take my feedback and grow with it.</p>
